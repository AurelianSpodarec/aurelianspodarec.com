  Blog Idea

  Job market and expectations, and what to do
  Desperate
  What if everyone does it? That's hypothetical, not everyone does but now you do. 





  Have a blog about me in details maybe


  talk about mindset, changes, what I'm workin on now, tailbuilder




  Id rather do better work with the current budget and timeframe, than do worse off job - id rather implement a better solution or clean up things, or make stuff really nice just mua mua than not.

So I wouldn't mind spending an extra hour, two, three once a while or whatever on something, so I can also create something good, learn off it, and also be proud of the work - even tho the client will never know about this.
