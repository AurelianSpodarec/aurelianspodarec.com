# But HTML Large and UGLY! Ewwww ðŸ‘¶ðŸ¤®ðŸ‘¼

The OVERALL file size you ship is smaller. Yea...

By writing CSS you actually type more characters


Compare this
```html
text-primarly
```

to this 

```css
color: text-primarly
```

13characters with TailwindCSS
20characters with normal CSS in a CSS file that you have to first navigate to...

WOW! 

And there you talking about verbosity... Hypocryte!




And not only that, you just created one more file! 


Wanna play a detective?

But Large projects... ON large projects you will need to search though your css files - wish you've became a detective? Its not too late! The police force needs more people [enroll now in the UK] 













My only CSS hot take is that with component-based frameworks, descriptive classes, and nested styles are obsolete.

In the past we used classes to give meaning to elements in lengthy markup files and make them easier to target with selectors.

Both are much easier now when the unit of work is a single component, not a whole page.

And if you need to apply styles to a nested element it would be better to extract a component instead and scope its styles to it.
