# TailwindCSS

Love it or hate it, you're using it anyway - you just don't know it.



Decoding the hype: Why TailwindCSS not as special as people make it seem


Make a issue








-- New article

But TailwindCSS has:

## Inline Styles 👴☎️

- Yes! While inline styles weree absolutelly HORRIBLE back in the 90s, things improved and we ahve components


## But I have to LEarn new stUuUuff 🧸🏖️

This is what you are being paid for.

Let me make this very clear; This isn't about TailwindCSS specific - it talks about YOUR character.

Every job you apply to, says "Willingnes to learn" - technology moves forward. 

If you want to have a cosy job learn math, that never changes.

And if you think you're better than the above...

Have you never learned Bootstrap? Foundation? Skeleton? Material? Daisy UI? Tachynos? Bulma? Semantic? And somehow you're fine with that?!

You don't want to learn "another" framework, but you're happy to keep learning others? You, my friend, are [BIASED]!

Maybe you're a noob or a self-proclaimed junior(senior?) - then you have no idea what you're talking about.


Beside


TW is a 1:1 ratio for CSS

Beside, you' are a SOFTWARE DEVELOPER, am I right? Tech moves fast, if you though you learn one thing and you stop, you're in the wrong indstry!

And you know this! So stop being lazy! Say that you need to learn a new thing at a job, and I guarnatee you'll never get hired again. Mark my words.




## But the file size is too BIG! Its TOO BIG 😨
TW compiles and generates only classes you used

## But HTML Large and UGLY! Ewwww 👶🤮👼

## And how do you do this complicated thing in TailwindCSS? 😏
You don't. 

You right click on your styles folder, and create a new file, name it 'complicated.scss' and write your css there! 

Better to write one or to files, instead of a few hundred.
