# TailwindCSS

Love it or hate it, you're using it anyway - you just don't know it.



Decoding the hype: Why TailwindCSS not as special as people make it seem


Make a issue








-- New article

But TailwindCSS has:

## Inline Styles

- Yes! While inline styles weree absolutelly HORRIBLE back in the 90s, things improved and we ahve components

## Need to learn new CSS
TW is a 1:1 ratio for CSS

## But the file size is too big! Its TOO BIG üò®
TW compiles and generates only classes you used

## And how do you do this complicated thing in TailwindCSS? üòè
You don't. You right click on your styles folder, and create a new file, name it 'complicated.scss' and write your css there! 

Better to write one or to files, instead of a few hundred. 


## But HTML UGLY! Ewwww
