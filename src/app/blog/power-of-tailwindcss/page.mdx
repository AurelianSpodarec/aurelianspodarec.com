# TailwindCSS

Love it or hate it, you're using it anyway - you just don't know it.



Decoding the hype: Why TailwindCSS not as special as people make it seem


Make a issue








-- New article------------------------------------------

The BIGGEST, most ellaborate with pictures QA about TailwindCSS!

But TailwindCSS...

## _has_ Inline Styles üë¥‚òéÔ∏è

- Yes! While inline styles weree absolutelly HORRIBLE back in the 90s, things improved and we ahve components

## Separation of Concern 

## But I have to LEaRn new stUuUuff üß∏üèñÔ∏è

Did you lie at your interview when they asked if you're willing to learn new tech? 




This is what you are being paid for.

Let me make this very clear; This isn't about TailwindCSS specific - it talks about YOUR character.

Every job you apply to, says "Willingnes to learn" - technology moves forward. 

If you want to have a cosy job learn math, that never changes.

And if you think you're better than the above...

Have you never learned Bootstrap? Foundation? Skeleton? Material? Daisy UI? Tachynos? Bulma? Semantic? And somehow you're fine with that?!

You don't want to learn "another" framework, but you're happy to keep learning others? You, my friend, are [BIASED]!

Maybe you're a noob or a self-proclaimed junior(senior?) - then you have no idea what you're talking about.


Beside


TW is a 1:1 ratio for CSS

Beside, you' are a SOFTWARE DEVELOPER, am I right? Tech moves fast, if you though you learn one thing and you stop, you're in the wrong indstry!

And you know this! So stop being lazy! Say that you need to learn a new thing at a job, and I guarnatee you'll never get hired again. Mark my words.


These days every article, every argument I hear from developers is "Con: Learning" - no shit, who wants to learn, just become a medicore code monkey and make 6figure sallary. Way to go!


TailwindCSS is grear to interview, why? If they say "Yea yea, one con is that you have to learn a new thigs" - RED FLAG! NEXT!
*then you wonder why you're failing job interviews, because you're LAZY!*

## But HTML Large and UGLY! Ewwww üë∂ü§Æüëº

The OVERALL file size you ship is smaller. Yea...

By writing CSS you actually type more characters


Compare this
```
text-primarly
```
to this 
```
color: text-primarly
```

13characters with TailwindCSS
20characters with normal CSS in a CSS file that you have to first navigate to...

WOW! 

And there you talking about verbosity... Hypocryte!




And not only that, you just created one more file! 


Wanna play a detective?

But Large projects... ON large projects you will need to search though your css files - wish you've became a detective? Its not too late! The police force needs more people [enroll now in the UK] 

## But the file size is too BIG! Its TOO BIG üò®

TW compiles and generates only classes you used

TailwindCSS uses something called "" - which reads your DOM HTML and uses only the classes you 


## And how do you do this complicated thing in TailwindCSS? üòè
You don't. 

"HAHA! GOTCHA!"

No, You abslutelly didn't.



You right click on your styles folder, and create a new file, name it 'complicated.scss' and write your css there! 

Better to write one or to files, instead of a few hundred. 


## Clients don't care if you use TailwindCSS or not - grow up!

Ye ye, "clients don't care what tech you use, all they care is if it works".

Are you talking to busienss people to develoeprs? We are talking about tech, to other tech professionals... - its not "just a tool"

And I'm not going to use a tool that's going to cut mt little finger off, and then I'm gonna lvie with this for the rest of my life - only to make some money. 

I, and other tech professionals actaully care what tool we're going to use.

Don't give us, the tech people BS lines like this, because we are not talkig about business, but tech! 


[wolf of wallstreet profile picture]



Now, the question is for you: Are you an ACTUALL tech professional, or not? WE tech professionals actually CARE about the tech we use.

We (the ones that care) want to do it well, advance the world with my little tailwindcss classes by making the web a little bit of a better, more accessible and less buggy, but prettier and safer place.


And just to enteterin your argument, tech saves money

Hence businesses are heavily investing into AI to automate these expensive software developers so this becomes a comodity.

Its why we have machines, and robots! Wooo


The faster you do this, the bette ryou do this, the better it will be for all of us - so everyone absolutelly do care what tech you use.

Use the wrong tech, it will cause trouble to the client and more costs - they think they don't care about tech, but they do, and if not, they definitelly should.

Bad code, bad software put busiensses away. And here you talking that clients don't care about code - explain to them why they should start caring about it.
